# hello-world
Let's take another stab at the "portfolio website" shall we?

## What
_The good-old portfiolio website_

## Why
_It's time that this "starter project" better reflected what I'm capable of._

## How
_Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to update my portfolio and showcase the 'basics'._


  Real talk, the website I kicked twitching and dry-heaving into existence back when I started this journey is now painfully inadequate.

  # Got a stable version up in a couple days.  Not where I want it to be, but not a bad start.
