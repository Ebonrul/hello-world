# hello-world
Let's take another stab at the "portfolio website" shall we?

## What
_The good-old portfiolio website_

## Why
_It's time that this "starter project" better reflected what I'm capable of._

## How
_Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to update my portfolio and showcase the 'basics'._


  Real talk, the website I kicked twitching and dry-heaving into existence back when I started this journey is now painfully inadequate.

Day 0: Put up a [wireframe](https://gist.github.com/Ebonrul/68c6f0a72121c2c3edf3ff3f6c87155a) that pretty much sums up what I'm going for. 
- Skipping this step has brought past projects to a grinding halt so here's to proving he can be taught.
Day 1: Got functionality up on the main page.
- Buttons do what they're supposed to do and navigate where they're supposed to go...for the most part.
Day 1.5: Cleanup
- Gotta pause to work on other assignments, but this is sitting in a pretty good place.  I could use chunks of it in other stuff right away.
